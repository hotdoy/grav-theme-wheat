# Wheat

## Description

Wheat is a Pop-up shop theme for Grav CMS using Snipcart. It is also the starter theme for everything getting out of Calotte. It's meant to be usable out of the box, reducing the installation process, maintenance and dependencies to a minimum. It uses vanilla everything (html, js, css) and completelly eliminate the build process. While the theme is opinionated, everything is packaged and documented (nope) to be as simple as possible, allowing someone with minimum coding knowledge to jump in as fast as possible.

## Tenets
- Stick to mobile
- Always choose the maintainable solution. 
- Keep it light and fast. Time is money.
- Think about the added value all the time. If something does not add value, ditch it.
- Reduce friction.
- Never put something that might block the user's journey (popups and stuff like that).
- Your site should be like a Call of Duty map. You should be able to never stop running and never be trapped in a corner.
