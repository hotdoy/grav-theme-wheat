# Plugins (WIP)

Most required plugins come packaged with the Grav CORE + Admin package. This list is mostly recommendations and thing I've seen myself install over and over so you do whatever you want with the info. Most of the time, you should probably not install a plugin if you don't know why you are doing it.
